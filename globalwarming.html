    <h3> Cause of Global Warming: Corporations </h3>

    <p> Corporations remain a leading contributor to global warming as industries continue to release a substantial amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These corporations aim to maximize their profit by any means necessary and in turn they end up creating long-term strains on the environment. For example, gas companies use fracking, a revolutionary drilling technique, in order to release large amounts of gas trapped inside of rock. Despite the large amounts of methane that is released from fracking, shale gas operations continue to use the technique to obtain the resource. This is just one example of the type of damage that fossil fuel companies have on the environment. According to the NRDC, “In the United States, the burning of fossil fuels, particularly for the power and transportation sectors, accounts for about three-quarters of our carbon emissions”. My art piece aims to show how many corporations today prioritize economic gain over environmental impact and are irreversibly altering the strength of the Earth’s atmosphere. </p>

    <p> Global warming has dramatically affected the Green Sea Turtle population around the world. As the world is experiencing a gradual warming, the temperature of sand is also affected. When sand is above 87 degrees Fahrenheit, it is more likely that turtle eggs laid in this temperature sand will be female. If global warming continues on the path that it is on, with the accelerating increase in temperature, green sea turtles will go extinct. A study in Australia showed that 99% of green sea turtles in this area are female. If we do not actively decrease our carbon footprint and combat global warming, these beautiful creatures will be extinct within our lifetime.</p>

    <p> For my drawing, I was inspired by the recent threats on the Artic Wildlife Refuge that would allow oil companies to invade the land of many critical species that occupy the space. Not only would this harm the animals living there but it could severely destroy the food production of the space as many indigenous communities rely on the land and have deep connections to it.  </p>

    <p> Global warming is a large issue plaguing the world that mostly goes unnoticed.  It is defined as the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere. The term is frequently used interchangeably with the term climate change, though the latter refers to both human- and naturally produced warming and the effects it has on our planet. It is most commonly measured as the average increase in Earth’s global surface temperature. Most of the current warming trend is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) the result of human activity since the 1950s and is proceeding at an unprecedented rate over decades to millennia. In my project, I sought to show two possible future scenarios, one if we continue this way and the other if we change. At the top, you can see the sun and the blue colors which represent a good environment. On the bottom, however, you can see an earth that is melting. In conclusion, this is what my project is about and a little about global warming.   </p>

    <p>My project is centered on how global warming affects antarctic penguins specifically Emperor penguins. An Article by biological diversity. Org says The loss of sea ice is harming Emperor penguin chicks and adults. Emperor penguins rear their chicks on land-locked sea ice. When sea ice breaks up before their chicks have matured and grown their waterproof feathers, chicks that are swept into the ocean are likely to die. For adults, the loss of sea ice can lead to lower food availability, which can result in increased mortality.” I think its important to bring awareness to the environmental threats that global warming has on penguins specifically emperor penguins.</p>

    <p> My project depicts the cruel effects of global warming on the Great Barrier Reef. A major effect is something called Coral bleaching. The main source of food for coral is algae and the bleaching causes the algae get out of the coral tissues, which then leaves the coral to starve and lose its color. This issue can happen even if the temperature changes by 2 degrees, and has devastating effects on the ecosystem and environment. Over half of the Great Barrier Reef is bleaching, or in other words dead. You can help by supporting a reef friendly business, or volunteering or donating to Cora reef beauty prevention programs such as the Great Barrier Reef foundation.  </p>

    <p> Within the past decade, several species of critically endangered animals have been on the brink of extinction from the effects of climate change.  The preservation of habitats is necessary for animal and plant species alike to successfully carry out their life cycles (grow and reproduce). When trees are cut down and burned or left to rot, their stored up carbon is released into the air in the form of carbon dioxide, raising carbon emissions, which contributes to global warming. Deforestation has imposed devastating factors among the habitats of animals, specifically, the Sumatran Tiger. According to National Geographic, “[o]f the habitat tigers rely on in Sumatra, approximately 17 percent was deforested between 2000 and 2012”(“Nature Communications”). This nominal percentage has only increased with time as the threat of extinction has made significant peaks with the deforestation of these Sumatran tiger habitats. These tigers are living in small, fragmented habitats in the status quo, unable to find sources of food or shelter from the once lush forests of Sumatra they called home. As the Sumatra forests have harvested an environment unsuitable for these animals, they are at risk of being hunted down, dying from starvation, or not being able to live long enough to reproduce. My drawing illustrates these complications by showing a side-by-side of a Sumatran tiger living in a healthy habitat on the top half, comparatively, to the bottom half showing their loss of a habitat as a result of deforestation. </p>

    <p> As temperatures keep rising, the population of polar bears will keep rapidly declining. Global warming has caused ice sheets in the north and south pole to melt at an extremely fast rate. It is estimated that the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are losing ice six times faster than they were in the 1990s. This negatively impacts polar bears due to how they depend on ice sheets to access their primary source of food, in addition to rest and breed. #SaveThePolarBears </p>
